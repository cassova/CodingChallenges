# Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition

Cracking the Coding Interview is a book written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell to help those prepare for coding/technical interviews at big tech firms.  In this folder, I have my solutions written in Python to the problems from the book.  The book's examples and solutions are written in Java so my approach was to see what solutions I could come up with and compare those with what the book's.  For some of the questions, I have multiple answers with different memory or time complexity or use shortcuts and vectorization available in some libraries like NumPy.


I recently found another source that has all the solutions in Python maintained by a community of volunteers:
