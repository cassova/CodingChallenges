# Daily Coding Problems

I signed up for this Sept. 14, 2021 to improve my technical interviews along with a friend.  If you sign up, I'd recommend convincing a friend to join you so you can work through different solutions together.  Espeically if you don't sign up for the pro version (the pro version gives you the solutions).  Because I don't have the pro version, I may not have the best solutions but they are at least my own work.
